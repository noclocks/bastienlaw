Throughout my practice, I put people first and use my nearly 25 years of experience to offer real solutions that can impact your life quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Learn about my professional history:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/attorney\/bastein-villard-s\/\">Villard Bastien<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How I Demonstrate My Commitment To My Clients<\/h2>\n<p>When I moved to Atlanta in 2008, I opened up the <span class=\"nap-item nap-item--name\">Law Offices of Villard Bastien, LLC<\/span>, where I mainly represent individuals who sustain injuries or who have died as a result of the negligence and malpractice of individuals or corporations, including those who have <a href=\"\/nursing-home-abuse\/\">suffered abuse in nursing homes<\/a>. This is after years of studying law across the globe in pursuit of my master\u2019s degree in international business law and even serving as an insurance adjuster for large insurance companies.<\/p>\n<p>I have taken a different approach to my <a href=\"\/other-practice-areas\/\">representation of injured individuals<\/a> and estate claims for the death of their loved ones. Each client becomes personal and has an intimate direction in their case. No two cases are similar. Each client gets the attention and\u00a0care\u00a0needed.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in giving back to the community \u2013 that we are all better off when we come together and that putting selfishness aside is an ideal way to multiply one\u2019s capabilities. I serve on multiple community boards, including the Community Assistance Center of Sandy Springs and Dunwoody and the Rotary Club of Dunwoody.<\/p>\n<h2>Speak With Me About Your Legal Needs<\/h2>\n<p>I am a native New Yorker, licensed to practice law in Georgia, New York and New Jersey.
