## 1A) Find and Review FindLaw Contract

In order to begin the escape from FindLaw, you first need to dig up your FindLaw contract and review it. 

Be sure to read the fine print and ask the following questions:

-   Exactly what ongoing services are FindLaw providing for you?
-   How much are you paying monthly for these services?
-   How long have you committed to them – 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, or more?
-   When’s the contract due for renewal?

The primary concern here is to understand and determine what phase the active FindLaw contract is in and exactly what services they are providing for you.

For example, FindLaw provides services such as:

-   Mobile Friendly Websites
-   Domain Hosting and Registration
-   Email Hosting and Server Setup
-   Google Services Setup and Management (Google My Business, Google Ads, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, etc.)
-   Legal Directory Listings and Promotions
-   Web Marketing Packages

Next, look for key clauses and areas of interest such as:

-   **Ownership**: This clause will aid in determining *who owns what*.
-   **Amendments**: This clause allows FindLaw to amend the original Agreement’s terms at their discretion
-   **Consent to Contact and Call Recording**: This clause states that you (the customer) allow FindLaw to contact and send forwarded messages
-   **Use of Data**: This clause allows FindLaw to collect data (cookies, pixels, marketing tags, etc.) and send that data to third parties. Additionally, the clause states that FindLaw owns this data and have the right to share it as necessary.
-   **Limitation of Claims**: This clause protects FindLaw by stating that no claim may be brought by either party more than 12 months after a service agreement ends (except for FindLaw to collect unpaid charges, of course).
-   **Termination**: The termination section outlines that either party can terminate an order by giving the other party written notice of its intent to do so, and the termination becomes effective 90 days after the notice is given. It also states that the agreement can be immediately terminated upon certain circumstances.

Some examples of what to look out for are below.

### Ownership

Hopefully, the Terms & Conditions states something along the lines of:

> "Ownership: Subject to your fulfilment of all payment obligations under this Agreement, we assign you all right, title, and interest we have in any work specifically created for you under the Agreement […]"

This would be beneficial because anything on the website (content, metadata, etc.) is owned by you, the customer and there should not be any ownership issues with transferring these items to the new hosting service.

However, if there are elements of your website that you are *leasing* from FindLaw, these will have to remain behind and not migrated. From reviewing the FindLaw service offering it seems like common *leased* items include:

- Live Chat
- Newsletters
- Forms
- Generic Practice Pages
- FAQs
- Phone Number Forwarding

Anything falling under this category can be re-developed by us in a more professional and direct manner. From initial review of the site it looks like there are a couple forms which we will replace with new forms that can forward to your email/phone as desired instead of be managed by FindLaw. However, I am not sure about the practice pages.

### Amendments

From the [Master Services Agreement](https://www.lawyermarketing.com/customer-support/master-services-agreement/):

> We may amend the Agreement terms at our discretion to address technological, operational, or regulatory changes affecting delivery of the Services and you agree to be bound by such amendments, [...].
> You may access the current FindLaw Master Services Agreement, including any revisions thereto, at: <https://lawyermarketing.com/master-services-agreement/>. 
> Any other amendment to the Agreement must be documented in a writing signed by both parties.

From this, be sure to review anything received from FindLaw.

### Other Important Items in the Contract

1.  **Automatic Renewal.** Following an Order Term, Services will automatically continue in effect at then-current list pricing until the parties agree on a renewal order or until one party terminates the agreement
2.  **Disclaimer of Warranty.** We make no guarantees, representations, or warranties to you regarding the results or performance of the Services, including the quality or volume of Internet traffic or business the Services will generate.
3.  **No Exclusivity or Conflict of Interest.** We may provide Services to law firms throughout the world, without limitation.
4.  **Limitation of Claims:** No claim arising out of or related to any Service may be brought by either party more than 12 months after the Service ends.

Next, you will want to review the Terms and Conditions. As a lawyer, you will be able to get to grips with them easier than most people however most law firms don’t even look at them.

>   Note that, depending on how long you have been with FindLaw, breaking the agreement may mean you have to buy out the remaining months on your contract.

>
>   If your contract ends you have the rights to your site content. You can work with your account manager to remove your site content available to you and have it sent directly to you so you can re-purpose it.

## 2) Determine What FindLaw is Providing and for What Cost

Next, break down exactly what you’re getting for your money.

If you have a relatively simple 8 to 10-page site, you’re probably paying in the region of $250 to $600 per month for your website on FindLaw, depending on whether it’s your first year or subsequent years.

In most cases, the cost of building the website is amortized over the first 12 months of the contract; so the monthly fee comes down after the first year.

From there, unless you actively engage with FindLaw regularly, you may find that the bills keep coming in but you’re not clear on what you’re actually getting for your money.

It can be confusing.

Additional services can run into thousands of dollars per month. The question to ask is, are you getting value for it?

**Monthly fees may include:**

-   **Domain name hosting** – your domain name is your website address, e.g. mytoplawfirm.com. If you got FindLaw to register it for you, there would also be a charge for this.
-   **Website hosting and ‘management’** – the hosting of your website and updates to its content, images and functionality.
-   **Email hosting** – is FindLaw hosting your email as well as your website?
-   **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** – a service designed to increase your website’s rankings in Google’s search results.
-   **Content creation** – the writing of blog articles, service pages and resources.
-   **Video and live chat** – video creation, marketing and the management of live chat.
-   **Pay Per Click (PPC) marketing services** – the management of optimization of your Google Adwords campaigns.

A listing in the **FindLaw legal directory** may generate two forms of traffic:

-   From your FindLaw profile
-   From directory placements

But it is costing you money every month. Work out what you’re paying for each click-through and lead from directory placements.

If every click is costing you $100 and they’re not converting into leads, it’s another expense that will inflate your monthly fee.

By analyzing your current set up with FindLaw, you can see what you’re currently spending – and look to reduce it by transitioning to a more cost-effective law firm marketing strategy.

## 3) Determine Who Controls the Domain

>   See Also:
>
>   [WHOIS search results (godaddy.com)](https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=bastienlaw.com&domainName=bastienlaw.com&seeUnderlyingRegistryData=true)

If you purchased your own domain, then you may have a GoDaddy account or similar.  

Find the login and password to this account.  

If *FindLaw* purchased the domain for you, we can see if they put it in your name, or theirs.  

### Perform a WHOIS Analysis of the Domain Name

To gain insights into how your domain name is registered and under what hosting provider/registrar, perform a `WHOIS` analysis of the domain name’s registration.

-   Go to <https://www.godaddy.com/whois> and search for your domain to find key details
-   To results for `bastienlaw.com` are below:

### Contact the Domain Holder

If necessary, put in a request to your *FindLaw* rep that you would like the *Registrant Contact, Administrative Contact and Technical Contact* changed to the name and contact info of your new IT agency.

If you are using an outsourced IT firm, make them the Technical Contact, and make the law firm the Registrant and Administrative Contact.  

Remember, domain names are like pieces of property and legally, these need to be in your name in case anything comes up so you will have the right to make decisions.

> **Important Note**:  Take a look at the expiration date on this record, and make sure it will not expire anytime soon, and register it for at least two years out.  All domain transfers come with a 1-year renewal.

-   Contact *Registrant*
-   Contact *Technical*
-   Contact *Admin*

## 3) Perform Full Inventory of Existing Website

Next, take a close look at all of the features and functions that *FindLaw* is providing on your website, because all of these services will need to be replaced.  

If you have video, *FindLaw* may be using Brightcove as the video player on your website.  You will want to get the raw video files in .mp4 format and get them into YouTube so they can be easily embedded on the new website later.  YouTube is more SEO friendly, and free compared to Brightcove.

If you were using live chat, once you move off of *FindLaw*, you will not be able to use their live chat service anymore. 

For contact forms, these will need to be re-developed by web developers and can point to any CRM of your choice.

For trackable phone numbers, there are a variety of choices out there.

Are you paying for mobile access with *FindLaw*?  Consider building a responsive theme so your site is rendered properly on any mobile device.  There will not be a need to pay any other 3rd party service for a “mobile-friendly version” of your website.

## 4) Begin Designing New Site

Start the process of recreating the design of your website.

Provide several options (themes) that include:

-   Home (Landing) Page
-   Attorney Biography Page
-   Areas of Practice Page(s)
-   Blog/Articles Page
-   About Page
-   Contact Page
-   Payment Gateway
-   Scheduling Page
-   Sitemap Page
-   Term & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookie Consent, etc.

## 5) Collect Static Assets

Collect Static Assets such as:

-   Primary Logo
-   Other Images and Photos
-   Color Palette and Graphics

## 6) Setup New Host Environment

Remember, once your *FindLaw* contract ends, they will not host your site anymore.  

Your web developer who is revamping the site’s design is going to need either “SSH access” or “FTP access” as well as the database credentials to set everything up.  

Once you have this server setup, go ahead and scrape the current site and set it up on this server – just in case your contract ends with *FindLaw* before the transfer is complete.



## 7) Transfer Domain Registrar

Replace the original domain setup by FindLaw with a new account managed by your new IT team / developers. This account will host your DNS records while the hosting provider serves the actual website. 

Change the primary nameservers.

1.   Login to current registrar and unlock the domain
2.   Copy the authorization code and send it to new registrar
3.   New registrar will initiate a *Domain Transfer Request* which will in turn cause whoever is listed as the domain’s *technical contact* to receive an email with instructions that include a transaction id and security code. This information will be sent to the new registrar.
4.   New registrar completes the process and the domain will be under their full control.
