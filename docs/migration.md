## Migration away from FindLaw.com

-   **Domain name hosting** – your domain name is your website address, e.g. mytoplawfirm.com. If you got FindLaw to register it for you, there would also be a charge for this.
-   **Website hosting and ‘management’** – the hosting of your website and updates to its content, images and functionality.
-   **Email hosting** – is FindLaw hosting your email as well as your website?
-   **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** – a service designed to increase your website’s rankings in Google’s search results.
-   **Content creation** – the writing of blog articles, service pages and resources.
-   **Video and live chat** – video creation, marketing and the management of live chat.
-   **Pay Per Click (PPC) marketing services** – the management of optimization of your Google Adwords campaigns.

The design and graphics on your website are owned by FindLaw – but you can buy them for four percent of the annual value of the website.

So if your site is costing you $10,000 per year, it will cost you $400 to purchase the design and graphics on a disc or via an HTML link.

Once you have these raw design files, they will need to be rebuilt by a web designer.

It’s typically not recommended to purchase these files.

Your domain name is the link to your ***email\*** as well as your ***website\***. ***Make sure you know where both are currently hosted\*** – are both with FindLaw?

-   If your domain name was registered by FindLaw, it needs to be transferred to your own account.
-   If you purchased your own domain name, you probably have your own GoDaddy account (or similar).

Again, you can check where your domain name is hosted by visiting https://www.whois.net/

Make sure you have the login details as these will be required when you change the hosting details of the website (and email) from FindLaw.

If your domain name is hosted by FindLaw, request that they change the *Registrant Contact*, *Administrative Contact* and *Technical Contact* of the domain name to the name and contact details of your IT person.

Alternatively, if you’re outsourcing the transition process, change the technical contact to their details and make your law firm the *Administrative* and *Registrant* contacts.

Also, check when the domain name renewal is due and ensure that it will not expire. If it is due to expire, register it for another couple of years. It won’t cost you more than $20.

Google Analytics is a platform that reports the performance of your website.

As explained, the content of your existing FindLaw website is yours, except where you are leasing content services like FAQs, blogs, generic practice pages, etc.

It may simply be a case of replicating what’s on the FindLaw server on the new web hosting servers you decide to use (such as WordPress).

You may also want to redesign some pages and update or add new content (such as live chat or a blog), so it’s best to work with a professional web designer during this process – more about this in Step 7 below.

**To establish exactly what you have to build on, take a simple inventory of your existing FindLaw website:**

-   What features and functions are on your current website?
-   Is FindLaw providing video, live chat, contact forms, trackable phone numbers etc.?
-   Is it mobile responsive?

Go through with your web designer what is currently on your site – what needs to be retained and what needs to be added.

## Ownership

This is traditionally one of the thorniest issues with FindLaw: *who owns what?*

Get clear on what you can take – and what you can’t – as this is central to a smooth transition process.

Previously, there were problems about ownership of the content on your site. You only owned what you wrote. This changed in the terms and conditions in recent times:

>   *“Ownership: Subject to your fulfilment of all payment obligations under this Agreement, we assign you all right, title, and interest we have in any work specifically created for you under the Agreement […]”* 

Anything that was custom-written for your firm is yours, including the meta data. So there should be no ownership issues with transferring this over to any web hosting service you choose.

However, if there are elements of your website that you are “leasing” from FindLaw (like with the example below from Laura Dale & Associates), these will have to remain behind.

### Gain Control of Domain

If FindLaw originally registered your domain name, you can get them to transfer the domain to you.

### Choose a New Static Site Host

If FindLaw built your website, they are currently hosting it. GoDaddy and Bluehost are two very common and reliable web hosts.



## Overview

**Villard Bastien** is one of Atlanta’s top personal injury attorneys with over 25 years of practice and established his own law firm, **Law Offices of Villard Bastien, LLC**. 

In order to market and establish the company’s brand, Villard has consulted **Jimmy Briggs** and **Patrick Howard**, both experienced web developers, to aid with migrating, revamping, developing & designing, and maintaining the website located at the domain: **bastienlaw.com** (https://www.bastienlaw.com).

The project is split into two primary milestones:

1.   Initial Website Migration and Revamp
2.   Additional Website Features and Functionality

## Existing Website

The existing website hosted at [bastienlaw.com](https://www.bastienlaw.com) was previously maintained and designed by [FindLaw](https://www.findlaw.com/) using their own, custom web hosting server and design system. The existing website provides basic functionality and information about the Law Firm through various sections, pages, and images. The site provides information on history and background of the firm as well as detailed services and product offerings related to Villard’s law services.

## Initial Migration

The primary aim of this project is to revamp the existing website while promoting a new, accessible format and promoting the best user experience possible. The site should act as a “central hub” for access to any and all information regarding Villard’s law practice and law firm. The site should include Web 3.0 technologies along with attention-grabbing presentations and information.

## Goals

1.   Backup current hosted site at [bastienlaw.com](https://bastienlaw.com)
2.   Create a development / test version of the static site for review and initial migration work
3.   Address all outstanding issues found with current website’s content and structure.
4.   

## Considerations and Concerns

-   need to know about [FindLaw’s contracts](https://precisionlegalmarketing.com/law-firm-marketing-blogs/non-flexible-contract/)
-   understand that [FindLaw](https://www.findlaw.com/) typically uses its own proprietary content management system (CMS). What this means is that if you ask them to create a website, that website is on their platform. If they create content for that website, it’s on their platform and in their system.
-   is the email server hosted by findlaw??
-   If Findlaw owns your domain name, ask them to add your firm and your IT or marketing consultant registrants in the account. This will then allow you to transfer the domain over to a hosting account that you own. Per your contract, you may have to pay a fee to do so, but you may have no choice.

So you want to end your contract – what about your image files, headshots, infographics, and site design? Do those just disappear? Sadly, you often are set up to lose all of that unless you pay a fee to FindLaw (consult your contract for specific details).

Findlaw contracts were structured in such a way that FindLaw owns your firm’s website while under contract.  The content is impermanent.  This means that once you stop paying for service, your content and links in high domain authority properties are removed.  This has resulted in many lawyers having a significant amount of trouble transferring site content once a contract is up. Inversely, owning your own website is essentially permanent and relatively inexpensive these days, with no need to tie yourself into a payment plan for the foreseeable future of your business, and any gains in ranking and web visits won’t vanish as soon as you stop paying high priced service fees.

Findlaw Holds Your Google Analytics, Google Ads or Tag Manager Accounts Hostage

The first step is to ask them to add your email address as an administrator or owner on each of these accounts (permissions vary by platform). Once you have the highest level of access, you’ll be able to add and remove users from those accounts, including FindLaw. We recommend that you work with someone skillful in these platforms during this process – FindLaw can say they made you an administrator, when in reality they only gave you permissions to view the data or something similar.

If they give you a hard time about transferring ownership of your Google Analytics and Google Ads account, don’t worry – it’s not a huge undertaking to set them up from scratch. At Majux, we can get your new Google Tag Manager and Analytics accounts (that you OWN), set up in a matter of hours, and we can even build a new Google Ads account (again, that you OWN), complete with campaigns, the same day if necessary.

Basically, don’t fight with FindLaw over your Google Analytics, Google Ads, or Search Console account – your new agency would be happy to set that up for you rapidly, and you won’t have to deal with FindLaw’s obstruction.
